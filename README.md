## About

Traducir is a webapp to work with Transifex translations collaboratively using Stack Exchange accounts, created by [Gervasio Marchand](https://github.com/g3rv4) in 2018. It was initially open-source, but in 2023 it was made closed source and [moved to StackExchange infrastructure](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/388400/370389). This project provides some additional features that are not included in official Traducir, such as translation history.

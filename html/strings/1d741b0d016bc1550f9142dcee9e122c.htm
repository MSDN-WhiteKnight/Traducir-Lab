It has come to our attention that {todo} of your answers consist primarily of text copied from other answers or websites. This is a violation of our Terms of Service, as well as the license agreement. It is considered plagiarism.

You are not allowed to simply copy content already available elsewhere and claim it as your own. That is, you must at least provide clear attribution, including the name of the original author, as well as add your own content to the post (it should not consist primarily of copied content). This remains true even if you change some of the wording or code a bit: if it&#39;s recognizable when you compare the two side-by-side, it needs to have attribution.

When quoting text from elsewhere, you must make it clear (using quote formatting) which parts of your answer are quoted, and from where. Just putting a link to the original source somewhere in the post does not count as attribution. Doing so is still implicitly passing off the content as original by not clearly indicating that it&#39;s from elsewhere. We encourage you to read [this]($referencingUrl$) answer for more information.

**Posts containing content from other sources must:**

  - Include the name of the original author.
  - Include a link to the original source.
  - Make it clear (using [quote formatting]($blockquotesUrl$)) **which parts of the answer are copied, and from where.** *Just putting a link to the original source somewhere in the post is not enough*, because it does not make it clear that it is the source of the content.  For more information, see [this answer]($attributionAnswerUrl$).
  - Add your own content to the post.  It should not be entirely (or almost entirely) copied content.

Even if you change some of the wording or code a bit, you still must credit the original source.  As a general rule, if it&#39;s recognizable when you compare the two side-by-side, it needs to give credit.

Any answers that we found with copied content that did not reference its source have been deleted.  If you wish to review them, you can view the [list of all of your deleted answers]($deletedAnswersUrl$) (which may also have answers deleted for other reasons).  If you have other answers that do not properly credit their sources, and you want to avoid them being removed, please edit them to follow the above requirements.

If there are specific answers of yours that you believe were not plagiarized (i.e., are your own, original work), and you would like to have these specific answers undeleted, you may reply to this message with a list of such answers. We will verify those individual answers and consider them for undeletion.

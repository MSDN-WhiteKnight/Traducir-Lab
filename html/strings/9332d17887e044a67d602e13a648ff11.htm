We’ve noticed that at least one of your posts consisted primarily or entirely of text copied from other posts or websites. Please do not simply copy content already available elsewhere in lieu of creating something that adds value to this site *specifically*.

As a general rule, posts should be your own original work, but when a great answer already exists elsewhere, including a small passage of text from another source can be a great way to support your solution. But please note that **we require full attribution** with a link to the original author, and please be sure you are ***not* copying content without permission**. For more information, please see [how to reference material written by others]($referencingUrl$).

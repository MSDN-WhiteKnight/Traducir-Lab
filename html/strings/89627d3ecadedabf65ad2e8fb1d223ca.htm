#Jumpstart your Team by inviting more users

We noticed you haven’t added any new users to your Team recently. Your Team is more likely to be successful when you add more users.
Invite Team users at: $inviteUrl$.

Want to make it easier to add coworkers to your Team? Enable email verification and allow all users with your email domain to join your team.

Why is this important?

Better and faster answers to questions.
When there are more users, you increase the chances of your question being answered.

A bigger and more robust knowledge base.
More team members lead to more knowledge sharing and collaboration.

A successful Q&amp;A community.
The Q&amp;A format works best when the right people are there to answer and ask questions.

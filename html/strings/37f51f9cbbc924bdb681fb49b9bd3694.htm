It has been called to our attention that you have asked the same question repeatedly.

If your question was closed or did not attract responses, then the first thing to do
is to *improve the question*; some guidance for this is [given here]($howToAskUrl$). Questions that aren’t up to standards are voted on and may be closed: this doesn’t mean they’re gone forever, as they can be reopened if improved or clarified (as appropriate). Please see our [editing]($editingUrl$) guidelines for how to improve your question.

However, please do not keep re-asking the same question. If your ability to ask questions has been suspended, do not create new accounts to circumvent our systems; this will result in increasingly longer suspensions being applied.

Use this tool to merge one question into another, causing the source question’s answers to be moved to the target question. Questions should only be merged if one question is an exact duplicate of the other, its answers would make perfect sense on the other question, and those answers are high-quality enough to be moved to the other question. The question to be merged must first be closed as a duplicate of the intended merge target.

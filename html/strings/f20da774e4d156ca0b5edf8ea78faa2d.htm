We recently noticed a substantial number of votes on your account to or from specific users. While we encourage everyone to upvote great posts and downvote bad ones, the motivation for doing so needs to be anchored in the merits of the *post*, **not the person who wrote it.** Please refrain from targeting specific users when voting.

Stack Exchange works by ensuring that the best information rises to the top. Voting specifically for content that benefits your friends, family or colleagues, or to harm a specific user, unfairly skews that system.

Please note that the votes in question will be invalidated. Our system has processes in place to detect various types of voting between groups of users, and these processes are continuously running. If you know anyone who may be voting for your contributions in kind, please ask them to stop before the system detects such activity and takes similar actions on their account.

Continued activity of this sort can result in increasingly longer suspensions. If you have any questions regarding this policy, please feel free to write back. If you created secondary accounts by mistake and would like to avoid possible future issues altogether, please use the [contact form]($contactUrl$) and select the &quot;I need to merge user profiles&quot; option, so you can merge them without further incident.

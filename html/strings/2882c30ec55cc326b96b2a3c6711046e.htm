Please do not roll back edits that objectively improve your post. Stack Overflow is a collaboratively curated resource. All users are encouraged to perform such edits.

The Help Center guidance about the edit privilege suggests the following:

Any time you see a post that needs improvement and are inclined to edit it, you are encouraged to do so.

Some common reasons to edit a post are:

- To fix grammatical or spelling mistakes
- To clarify the meaning of the post (without changing that meaning)
- To include additional information only found in comments, so that all of the information relevant to the post is contained in one place
- To correct minor mistakes or add updates as the post ages
- To add related resources or hyperlinks
- If you demand full editorial control over your posts, please consider whether Stack Overflow is the platform where you really want to post content. As long as you do contribute here, we expect you to accept the collaborative nature of the site.

Furthermore, repeatedly rolling back edits has the negative effect of bumping the question to the top of the &quot;Active&quot; tab, thus displacing questions that have meaningful activity. Please do not create more work for moderators and curators by resisting these edits.

Yes indeed and there are a couple of way to go about it on Stack Overflow Enterprise:

# Notify someone

You can click &#39;Notify&#39; on a post and choose from the list of Team members. This will leave a notification for them in the top bar.

# Share a link

Having more people from your team active on the site increases its usefulness. You can do this by clicking the &#39;share&#39; link on a post and copying the URL to then send to the appropriate users via email, chat channels or however else your team communicates.

$teamName$ Team&#39;s login security has been upgraded

Use single sign-on (SSO) to join your Team. SSO lets you log in using an existing set of credentials.

Log in with SSO at $loginUrl$

---

Can I still use my $outerSiteName$ account?
Yes! This is an added layer of security for your Team only.

Why was my Team&#39;s login security upgraded?
Many companies prefer to use SSO because it provides stronger security for sites containing sensitive data.

Will I lose my past Team activity?
No, your past activity will be saved. Once you&#39;ve logged in, we recommend double-checking your account to make sure everything is up-to-date.

Log in with SSO at $loginUrl$

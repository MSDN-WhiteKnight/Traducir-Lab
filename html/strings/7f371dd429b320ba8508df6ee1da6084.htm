We recently noticed a substantial number of votes on your account to or from specific users. While we encourage everyone to upvote great posts, the motivation for doing so needs to be anchored in the merits of the *post*, **not the person who wrote it.** This is just a reminder to please refrain from targeting specific users when voting. 

Stack Exchange works by ensuring that the best information rises to the top. Voting specifically for content that benefits your friends, family or colleagues unfairly skews that system, and continuing to do so can result in a lengthy suspension for all involved.

Please note that the offending votes have been invalidated. The system has processes in place to detect various types of voting between groups of users, so if you know anyone who may be voting for your stuff in kind, please ask them to refrain before the system detects such activity and takes similar actions on their account. If by chance you created separate accounts for the purposes of voting for another, please use [the contact form](/contact) and the appropriate option so you can merge them without further incident.

This is often just a simple misunderstanding, so no harm done. But continued activity of this sort can result in a prolonged suspension for all involved, so please let me know if you have any questions regarding this policy.

We noticed that many of your posts include things like signatures, tag lines, or other information that isn’t part of your question or answer. We have a [place in your profile]($editProfileUrl$) where you can tell us all about yourself, and it’s directly linked from everything you write - there’s no need to include such information in your posts.

On traditional discussion forums it is often customary to be less formal and more individual, but at $siteName$, one of our goals is to build a library of high-quality questions and answers where it’s as easy as possible to find the best answer. We know it can take some adjustment, but it’s our &quot;just the answers&quot; ethos that results in questions getting great answers, often extremely quickly.

We look forward to your future contributions. You can also share more about yourself in your profile. We actually love to see it there - it gives the community a little color - but we try to keep it out of the main Q&amp;A. If you have questions about this, please feel free to ask.

After reports of unusual voting patterns coming from your account, we found a lot of downvoting against specific users.

Please note that these downvotes have been invalidated. We need to ensure that the voting on Stack Exchange is anchored in the quality of the *post*, and **not the person who wrote it**.

If this is a simple misunderstanding, no harm done. The system has processes in place to detect various types of targeted voting between users, so if a user has wronged you in some way, please just move on. Everyone has their own criteria for why they vote, and sometimes we have to tolerate small indiscretions, even if those reasons are somewhat ill-advised. I&#39;m not saying that is the case here, but voting irregularities are something that we take very seriously and can result in a prolonged suspension for all involved.

This is just a friendly notice to let you know what happened, so take care and enjoy the site.

Hi there,

You’ve taken the time to get your new Stack Overflow for Teams space prepped and ready for your team members to share knowledge - congrats! Did you know that with our Dashboard, you can monitor metrics that tell you the types of wisdom your team is sharing or looking for?

We’re here to help you get familiar with your Dashboard and understand what it all means. Check out this post where we dig into the metrics you see and help you decide what’s most important for your team’s success.

Decipher your dashboard now &gt;&gt; $dashboardUrl$

Cheers,
Stack Overflow for Teams

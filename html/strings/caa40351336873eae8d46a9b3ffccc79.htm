Hi there,

We’ve recently rolled out some changes to our plans and pricing. The Basic plan will now have access to Single Sign-On (SSO).

This also means there will be a $1 increase per user for our Basic plan customers.

SSO is available immediately and pricing changes will take place on May 5th, 2021. You’ll notice the change in your following billing cycle.

If you have questions about these changes, please reach out to our support team.

Cheers,
Stack Overflow for Teams

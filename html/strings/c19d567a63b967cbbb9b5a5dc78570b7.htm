We noticed that some of your posts seem to exist only to promote your product or website. Our [policy on promotion]($promotionUrl$) says:

&gt; The community here tends to vote down overt self-promotion and flag it as spam. Post good, relevant answers, and if some (**but not all**) happen to be about your product or website, that’s okay. However, you *must* disclose your affiliation in your answers.

Any type of &quot;astroturfing&quot; or other guerrilla marketing promotion is not acceptable. It brings down the overall value of genuine recommendations for everyone on the site, and future instances of this may result in action, up to and including the loss of your account.

We welcome future contributions that are compliant with our guidelines, and hope that you will offer questions and answers of genuine benefit to the community.

The SAML certificate of team $teamName$ will expire on $expirationDuration$.

Please prepare to support the team&#39;s admins to renew their certificates from their identity provider.

If they don&#39;t act in time they risk locking out their entire team once the certificates have expired.

We have send an email to the team&#39;s admin to notify them about the upcoming expiration and asked them to renew their certificates.

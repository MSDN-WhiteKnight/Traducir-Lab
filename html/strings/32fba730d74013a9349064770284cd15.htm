Hi there,

In a perfect world, your team would be sharing knowledge in one place 24/7 - but in the real world, we know that people communicate across several platforms which leaves knowledge fragmented and hard to wrangle.

By connecting your commonly-used tools like Slack and Microsoft Teams with your new Stack Overflow for Teams instance, you’re ensuring that no matter where people are sharing information, you’re able to retain those conversations.

You can quickly integrate with the following tools:

     - Slack at $slackLink$
     - Microsoft Teams at $teamsLink$
     - Jira at $jiraLink$
     - GitHub Enterprise at $githubLink$

Want to learn more about our API? Check out the support documentation at $apiLink$.

Cheers,
Stack Overflow for Teams

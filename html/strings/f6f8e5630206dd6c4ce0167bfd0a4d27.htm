Hi there,

Too often in life we stumble upon something that promises big and under-delivers. We hate that. Which is why we award points to answers that get upvoted by your fellow team members. Someone thinks your content is valuable? You get the points.

Points are a way to signal to your team (and leadership) that you’re a wealth of knowledge - and a great way to get acknowledged for sharing that knowledge to help your team be their best.

So what are you waiting for? Contribute some great answers for your team and start building your credibility today.

Start engaging with your team’s content today &gt;&gt; $url$

Cheers,
Stack Overflow for Teams

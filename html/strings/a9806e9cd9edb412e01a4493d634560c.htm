Hi!

The [moderator elections]($url$) have started and I wanted to remind you that you need to nominate yourself if you wish run in the election.

Your temporary moderator appointment is ending and all moderators must be elected by the community. At the end of the election, the moderator access will be switched over to election winners.

I hope you will participate in the moderator elections, but if you chose not to run, I invite you to provide feedback about your experiences and why you chose not to run.

But most of all I would like to thank you again for your role in helping the site reach this important milestone.Without the help and leadership of volunteers like you, this site would not have been possible.

$adminName$ has chosen you as a leader on the team to help your colleagues get answers fast.

Tips to get started as a Subject Matter Expert:

* Ask your first question. Lead by example. The best way to spark engagement is to seed the Team with useful questions. What are the most common questions you get asked?
* Challenge your team. Make it fun for the team to contribute questions and answers. Challenge them to post a question a day for one week.
* Influence conversations. Help askers get answers by mentioning team members who are experts in the subject area and adding helpful suggestions in the comments.
* Edit any post. When you see something wrong, fix it—whether that’s a typo or outdated info. It’s important to maintain the quality of your team’s private Q&amp;A.

When bots or other tools are used to automate actions, the operator and/or user who authorized the use of their account is fully responsible for the bot&#39;s actions as if performed by themselves. For bots or tools created with the intent to violate the rules which apply to a user or account, the creator may also be held responsible. Where these tools co-ordinate votes or flags between multiple users, it should be with the express permission of Stack Exchange in writing by one of its employees.

Read the question carefully. What, _specifically_, is the question asking for? Make sure your answer provides that –
            or a viable alternative. The answer can be “don’t do that”, but it should also include “try this instead”. 
            Any answer that gets the asker going in the right direction is helpful, but do try to mention any limitations,
            assumptions or simplifications in your answer. Brevity is acceptable, but fuller explanations are better.

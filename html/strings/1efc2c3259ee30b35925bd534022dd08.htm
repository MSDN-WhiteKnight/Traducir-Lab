We received reports of unusual voting patterns coming from your account. After an investigation, we found a pattern of downvoting the contributions of specific users. You should not be targeting users with downvotes for any perceived wrongs they’ve done to you. Believing that someone has downvoted one of your posts is not a reason to downvote their posts in return.

On the Stack Exchange network, we believe that votes should reflect the quality of the post, not your general feelings about the person who wrote it. So please note that these targeted downvotes will be invalidated. Our system has processes in place to detect various types of targeted voting between users, so voting of this type will fairly quickly be discovered. If another user has done something to offend you, rather than downvoting them, flag it for moderator attention or use the [contact form]($contactUrl$) to send a report to us.

Continued activity of this sort can result in increasingly longer suspensions for those doing it. If you have any questions regarding this policy, please feel free to write back.

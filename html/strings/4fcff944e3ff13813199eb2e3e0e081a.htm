Stack Exchange uses your on-site activity to customize your experience and show you more relevant content.
Practically speaking, this might mean showing you suggested questions that are more likely to be of use to you, based on the tags and technologies you usually browse.
Or not showing you job listings in Papua New Guinea if you happen to live in Texas (unless you seem sort of unhappy there).
It is not used to help other websites sell you pants, based on your interest in pant-based technologies here.
In fact, both your historical site activity, and any predictions derived from it, are governed by our [privacy policy]($privacyPolicyLink$).
Which means that any data that can be linked personally to you is not distributed to any third parties who are not subject to our privacy policy.

# CONGRATULATIONS
## Your work life is about to get an upgrade

$siteName$ for Teams is a private, secure home for $channelName$ questions and answers. No more digging through stale wikis and lost emails - Stack Overflow for Teams’ engine makes it easy for you to get answers, fast.

Tips to get you started:

* Ask your first question. What’s on your mind today? What do you need to get your job done? What are the most common questions you get asked?
* Answer a question. There’s no better feeling than having the right answer to a question. Chances are more than one person will have the same question.
* Mention your team members. Even if you don’t have the answer, you might know who does. Help others find answers by mentioning teammates in the comments of question posts.
* Edit any post. When you see something wrong, fix it—whether that’s a typo or outdated info. It’s important to maintain the quality of your team’s Q&amp;A.

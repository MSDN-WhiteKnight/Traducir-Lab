We noticed that a substantial proportion of your posts seem to exist only to promote your product or website. Per the [help center]($behaviorUrl$):

&gt; Be careful, because the community frowns on overt self-promotion and tends to vote it down and flag it as spam. Post good, relevant answers, and if some (but not all) happen to be about your product or website, so be it. However, you *must* disclose your affiliation in your answers. Also, if a huge percentage of your posts include a mention of your product or website, you&#39;re probably here for the wrong reasons. Our advertising rates are quite reasonable; contact our ad sales team for details.

Any type of &quot;astroturfing&quot; promotion is not acceptable.  It brings down the overall value of genuine recommendations for everyone on the site.

If you can stay within the above guidelines, and offer questions and answers of genuine benefit to the community which happen to mention your affiliation or product in context -- and with full disclosure -- then your future contributions are welcome.

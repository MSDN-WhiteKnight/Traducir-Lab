We’ve noticed a pattern of engaging in lengthy discussions in comments, frequently consisting of responses involving multiple, back-to-back posts. Comments are intended as brief messages to [provide feedback, add minor information, ask for clarification, or discuss the *content of the post*]($commentUrl$). Lengthy clarifications should be edited into the post itself or posted separately as a new question or answer, and extended discussions should be taken to [chat]($ChatUrl). Extensive comment threads tend to be a distraction for other readers. **These lengthy discussions are often hard to follow, and can easily hide critical information.**

Our goal is to provide readers with expert questions and answers, **not** host discussion or debate. If you desire conversation, [stop into the site’s chat room]($chatUrl$).

We hope that you can work with the community on achieving our goals by:

- Asking [specific, researched, relevant, on-topic questions]($howToAskUrl$)
- Providing [clear, useful, accurate and well-researched information in answers]($howToAnswerUrl$)
- Treating others with [respect and civility]($behaviorUrl$)

Although it was posted as an answer, it contained nothing more than a link to an off-site resource and that does not meet our [minimum standards for an answer]($howToAnswerUrl$). Flagging it as *Not an answer* or *Very low quality* so that the post could be removed and then using the *$SkipAction$* on the review would have been more appropriate.

Being suspended can be a frustrating experience, but correct reviews help us maintain quality content on the site.

In the meantime, you can refer to the [help center]($GeneralReviewsHelpUrl$) for more information and revisit your recent reviews.

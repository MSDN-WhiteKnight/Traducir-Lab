Moderation is all about communication. Learn to live on your Meta site—this is your community’s town hall, library, and courthouse,
the place where you’ll answer questions, debate policy, share ideas and concerns over the direction of the site. Don’t hesitate to
ask for feedback from your community when you’re unsure of how to act (with the exception of sensitive issues involving non-public
user information, which you should bring up in The Teachers Lounge). Leave breadcrumbs on the main site: ideally, the community should police
itself, but sometimes you have to act and you should try to take the opportunity to let members know what you did. Leave a comment saying
things like &quot;It’s better if we don’t split the answers up between multiple threads so I am closing this as a duplicate.&quot; New users
will see these signposts and learn to use the system that much quicker. Direct them to Meta if they have questions or wish to debate your reasoning.

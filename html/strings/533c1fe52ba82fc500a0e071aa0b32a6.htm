Teams on Stack Overflow are implemented on strictly segregated database schemas. Content on a Team can not be seen by anyone who is not signed up for your Team. That includes high-reputation users, moderators and even employees of Stack Overflow. Some employees have access to anonymous metadata about your Team, but that&#39;s limited under our terms of service and because we respect your privacy. It&#39;s our Prime Directive for Teams.

Nobody outside your Team can see that you are a member. Earning 200 reputation on the Team will grant you an [association bonus](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/141648/what-is-the-association-bonus) if you haven&#39;t already earned it on another site on the network. But there&#39;s no indication of where you earned it.

We&#39;re always on guard against unauthorized access to private data. One step we take is to hire outside security experts who test our systems and look for vulnerabilities.

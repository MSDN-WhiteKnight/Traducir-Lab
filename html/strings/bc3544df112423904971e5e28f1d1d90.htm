It has come to our attention that you, or someone using your account, has been using multiple accounts to artificially game our systems. The duplicate accounts will be removed and the votes invalidated. Please refrain from using secondary accounts to circumvent our systems in the future.

It is not fair to other users of $siteName$ to allow users to gain reputation through [sockpuppets]($sockPuppetsUrl$).

Please be aware that we take the integrity of the Stack Overflow systems very seriously, and future incidents of this type will result in increasingly longer suspensions being applied to your profile. However, we know that in some cases, there are legitimate reasons for operating a second account - that is okay, as long as you adhere to the rule that you can&#39;t use the second account to do anything that wouldn&#39;t be possible with just one account. If you&#39;d like to avoid possible future issues altogether, please use the [contact form]($contactUrl$) and select the &quot;I need to merge user profiles&quot; option, so that we can merge them without further incident.

To help people looking for your question in the future (including your future self!), use existing tags if they apply. Remember that a question can have up to 5 tags, so use any that might be helpful for your team. If appropriate, include a tag for product lines, specific projects, or internal teams that are relevant to the question.

- The tags from the public Stack Overflow site are available for you convenience, so your Team can follow the same pattern of using [technology-specific tags](https://stackoverflow.com/tags).
- Team-specific tags can be found by clicking on the Tags link in the left sidebar under your Team.


You can also create a new tag if needed - just type the name of the tag into the box. Edit the description of a tag by clicking on it and selecting &quot;Improve tag info&quot; - this information can help others determine what the tag is for and how it should be used. For more tag tips, [see the help pages](https://stackoverflowteams.help/en/articles/8872158-tags).

You have recently removed or defaced a lot of content from your posts. Please note that once you post a question or answer to this site, those posts become part of the collective efforts of others who have also contributed to that content. Posts that are potentially useful to others should not be removed except under extraordinary circumstances. Even if the post is no longer useful to the original author, that information is still beneficial to others who may run into similar problems in the future - this is the underlying philosophy of Stack Exchange.

Extensive deletions take a lot of effort to repair; please read [&quot;I&#39;ve thought better of my question; can I delete it?&quot;]($deleteAlternativesUrl$) for possible alternatives. I have placed your account on hold for $todoSuspendMarker$ days while I reach out to you to avoid any further misunderstandings. Once this matter has been resolved, your reputation score will be restored and your account will resume as normal.

Please respond to this message. I sincerely hope this is just a misunderstanding, but if you feel you have an exceptional reason to remove this content then let me know. If you&#39;d prefer, you can contact Stack Exchange directly through the &#39;contact us&#39; link at the bottom of the site.

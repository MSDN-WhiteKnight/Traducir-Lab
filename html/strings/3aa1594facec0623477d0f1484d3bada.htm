#Add a verified email domain

Verifying an email domain makes it easier for coworkers to join your Team.
Instead of manually inviting users, a verified email gives anyone with your company email domain the ability to join your Team.
Verify your email domain at $verifyDomainUrl$

Why is this important?

Better and faster answers to questions.
When there are more users, you increase the chances of your question being answered.

A bigger and more robust knowledge base.
More team members lead to more knowledge sharing and collaboration.

A successful Q&amp;A community.
The Q&amp;A format works best when the right people are there to answer and ask questions.

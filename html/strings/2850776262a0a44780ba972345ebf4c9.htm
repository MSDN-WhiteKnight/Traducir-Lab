Hi there,

Changing behaviors is hard. Especially when we’ve grown so accustomed to instant messages and rapid-fire responses. But there are a few problems with that approach:

     - The information we get in response could be inaccurate or partial
     - We’re causing distractions for our high-value teammates
     - Resurfacing information from a sea of chat messages is a huge pain

But you don’t have to choose them (Slack, Microsoft Teams) or us. You can have it all. Our integrations will help your team access and share knowledge in a way that makes sense. No more searching endlessly for the right information.

Set up the integration for Slack at $slackUrl$ or Microsoft Teams at $msTeamsUrl$ today.

Cheers,
Stack Overflow for Teams

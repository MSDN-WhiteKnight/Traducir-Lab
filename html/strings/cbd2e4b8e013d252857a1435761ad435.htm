Hi there,

Sometimes adding new information to a shared space can be intimidating - sort of like raising your hand in class as the new kid in town. That’s why we built Reactions and Upvotes on Stack Overflow for Teams.

You can give content a few positive reactions to help the content creator know what you think of the question or answer. Someone asked a question that you have been wanting to know yourself? Drop a &#128293; emoji or &#128079;.

Think a question or answer needs to get more attention? Upvoting can make it more visible and signal to other team members that the content is valuable.

Start engaging with your team’s content today &gt;&gt; $url$

Cheers,
Stack Overflow for Teams

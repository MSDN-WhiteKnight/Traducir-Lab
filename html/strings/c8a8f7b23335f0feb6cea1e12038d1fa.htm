Due to clear signs of falsified accounts being used to artificially inflate your reputation, your account has been temporarily suspended for $todoSuspendMarker$ days.

It is not fair to other users of $siteName$ to allow users to gain reputation through [sockpuppets]($sockPuppetsUrl$).

The offending accounts have been removed and the votes invalidated. Please refrain from this behavior in the future.

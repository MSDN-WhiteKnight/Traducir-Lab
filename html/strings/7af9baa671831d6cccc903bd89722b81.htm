We really want you to have a good experience here, and the first step to that is making sure that questions you submit are clear, on topic and provide all of the information someone would need to answer. You may have noticed that questions you’ve asked weren’t well received by the community; they were downvoted and closed. 

Specifically, we would like to highlight these questions:

&lt;!-- Please add examples here or remove the line above --&gt;

There are a number of potential reasons for this and we’d like to help you diagnose exactly what’s happening. Questions may be downvoted and closed because they fit one of our [closure criteria]($closedQuestionUrl$), or are of the [type that we’d prefer users refrain from asking]($dontAskUrl$). While we’re excited that you’re contributing, we ask that you please take some time to read the information linked below - prior to asking another question - in order to assure the best possible experience (both for yourself, and also for other community members):

 - A brief [guide on how to ask questions]($howToAskUrl$)
 - A short summary of [questions we permit]($onTopicUrl$)

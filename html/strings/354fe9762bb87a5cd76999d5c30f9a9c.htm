When votes are cast improperly, it devalues the credibility of the network. We ask users to vote for the post, not the person who wrote it. As such, we do not allow targeted votes. Votes are considered targeted when cast in quick succession or in such a way that no longer looks organic, i.e., actions taken that otherwise fall outside of normal voting patterns. This could happen for a variety of reasons, such as when a user finds a great answer by another user and visits their profile to upvote many of their posts, when a user goes to their colleagues’ posts just to upvote them, or when a user gets into an argument with another user and downvotes their posts in revenge. No matter the cause, this sort of targeted voting is not permitted.

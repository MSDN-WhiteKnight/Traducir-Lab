It has come to our attention that you have been using multiple accounts to circumvent system limitations.

The most common limitations for people to attempt to evade are the system imposed question and answer bans. When you&#39;re getting the message &#39;We are no longer accepting questions/answers from this account&#39;, then you should act as if you are getting that message on all of your accounts and not post additional questions or answers (whichever you&#39;re hitting), even if you have an alternate account which is not banned. For more detail about question and answer bans and what you can do to get out of them, please see [What can I do when getting “We are no longer accepting questions/answers from this account”?]($closedQuestionUrl$).

Having more than one account is only permitted if the additional account is not used to circumvent such limitations, the accounts do not interact with each other, or otherwise allow you to do things which you would not be permitted to do with a single account. If you are interested in more information about having more than one account, please see [What are the rules governing multiple accounts (i.e. sockpuppets)?]($sockpuppetAnswerUrl$),

All system and moderator-imposed limits/blocks/bans/suspensions/etc. apply to the user, not just a single account. You are not permitted to create one or more new accounts in order to get around such limitations. If you are hitting a limit on one account, then you should act as if you were hitting that limit on each of your accounts.

The extra accounts will be deleted together with any unanswered questions. Please refrain from using secondary accounts to circumvent our systems in the future.

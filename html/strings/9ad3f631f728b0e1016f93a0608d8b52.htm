Stack Overflow for Teams is a platform designed to keep your team’s knowledge in one central location, and up to date. Ever tried searching for something in email or chat? The results can be less than accurate and oftentimes the sheer volume is overwhelming. Teams keeps a living account of wisdom that normally gets passed down through chats, emails, and face-to-face conversations.

We structure knowledge the way that we naturally learn - through asking and answering questions.

Flagging: Users flag things for all sorts of crazy reasons. You will act on a pretty small percentage of them. Users will flag
saying &quot;this is a dupe&quot; and &quot;this is subjective&quot; and, my favorite, &quot;this is spam.&quot; Users call anything they don’t like &quot;spam,&quot;
trying to get rid of posts through you as a super-vote-by-proxy. Remember, there is a community voting on this stuff. You don’t
have to act on everything when the community can decide for themselves.
In general, I’ll dismiss the flag as valid when I act on it (the system will take care of this for you in some cases). If I don’t
act but I think it may warrant observation, I’ll leave it around. If the flag is not useful at all, dismiss as invalid.

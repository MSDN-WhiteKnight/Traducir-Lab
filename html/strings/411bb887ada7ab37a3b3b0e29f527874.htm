We’ve noticed that at least one of your posts contains text copied from other published material without indicating the source of the text.

As a general rule, posts should be your original work, but including a small passage of text from another source can be a great way to support your post. Please note that **we require full attribution** with a citation/link indicating the original source, and make sure that you **clearly distinguish quoted text from text written by you**. For more information, please see [how to reference material written by others]($referencingUrl$).

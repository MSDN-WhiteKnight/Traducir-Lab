I wanted to let you know that we&#39;ve observed some rudeness in your latest activity. We get it; anyone who&#39;s ever tried to engage with others online has probably been tempted to lash out at someone else. This is just a friendly reminder that we [require all participants to act in a professional and civil tone when using these sites]($beNiceUrl$). If another user has wronged you in some way, please do not respond in kind. Simply flag the content for moderator attention and move on.

If this is a simple misunderstanding, no harm done. Sometimes it is helpful to remind ourselves on occasion that keeping things friendly and constructive doesn&#39;t have to be at odds with being right — so enjoy the site, bring your sense of humor, and please be tolerant of others who may not know everything you know.

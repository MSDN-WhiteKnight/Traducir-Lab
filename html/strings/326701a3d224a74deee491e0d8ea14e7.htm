Hi there,

Your success is our business. We built Stack Overflow for Teams because team leaders came to us repeatedly asking for ways for their teams to share company knowledge in a secure way. Since the launch of Teams, we’ve been slightly obsessed with making your team’s experience better.

We put together this resource center at $gettingStartedLink$ with things like:

    - Creating starter content
    - Leveraging your subject matter experts
    - Integrating with other tools like Slack and Microsoft Teams

Check out the resource center at $gettingStartedLink$ today to get your Team up and running toward success.

Cheers,
Stack Overflow for Teams

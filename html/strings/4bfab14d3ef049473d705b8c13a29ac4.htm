Some of your recent interactions with other community members have violated our [Code of Conduct]($conductUrl$). We get it; anyone who&#39;s ever tried to engage with others online has probably been tempted to lash out at someone else. However, on our sites, we do require all participants to interact in a professional and civil manner. If another user has wronged you in some way, please do not respond in kind. Simply flag the content for moderator attention and move on.

In particular, we would like to call out the following interactions as being problematic and having contributed to sending this message:

&lt;!-- Please consider adding examples of the problematic behavior here. Research shows this helps with decreasing recidivism. If you do not include examples, delete the paragraph above. --&gt;

&lt;!-- choose one of the following paragraphs --&gt;

&lt;!-- option 1 --&gt;
Please refrain from this behavior in the future. We take the Code of Conduct very seriously and we encourage you to take a moment now to review it. We’d like you to not only consider your intent, but also the impact your interactions are having on others. And while we hope it’s unnecessary, we want to make sure that you’re aware that future incidents of this type could result in your profile being suspended.

&lt;!-- option 2 --&gt;
Your recent interactions cross a line and need to stop because they affect others negatively. We take the Code of Conduct very seriously and encourage you to take a moment now to review it, as further violations will result in increasingly longer suspensions being applied to your profile.

&lt;!-- option 3 --&gt;
Your recent interactions are clear violations of our Code of Conduct and are unacceptable on our platform. You need to cease this behavior if you wish to continue participating in our websites; future violations will result in further action, up to your profile being suspended for several months or years.

&lt;!-- choose one of the above paragraphs --&gt;

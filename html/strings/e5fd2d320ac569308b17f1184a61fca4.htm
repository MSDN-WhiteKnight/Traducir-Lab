You have recently removed or defaced content from your posts. Please note that once you post a question or answer to this site, those posts become part of the collective efforts of others who have also contributed to that content. Posts that are potentially useful to others should not be removed except under extraordinary circumstances. Even if the post is no longer useful to the original author, that information is still beneficial to others who may run into similar problems in the future - this is the underlying philosophy of Stack Exchange.

Extensive deletions take a lot of effort to repair; please read [&quot;I’ve thought better of my question; can I delete it?&quot;]($deleteAlternativesUrl$) for possible alternatives. Because of the amount of disruption these incidents can cause, we have placed your account on hold for $todoSuspendMarker$ days while we reach out to you to avoid any further misunderstandings. Once this matter has been resolved, your reputation score will be restored and your account will resume as normal.

We sincerely hope this is just a misunderstanding, but we understand that you may have an exceptional reason to remove this content. If so, let us know by replying to this message.

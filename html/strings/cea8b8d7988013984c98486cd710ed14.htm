Stack Overflow for Teams is here for company-specific information. Questions regarding onboarding processes, key sales accounts, or what tools you have access to are all examples of topics to keep in your private Team. Simply put; if you have a question that you know others will benefit from, drop it in Stack Overflow for Teams.

If you are one of those people that finds themselves answering the same questions on repeat, then you can actually ask and answer your own question. This allows you to simply point team members to the knowledge. If someone needs further clarification, they can add a comment to the answer and you’ll be notified. You can then respond when it works best for your workflow.

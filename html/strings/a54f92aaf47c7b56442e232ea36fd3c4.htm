When your moderator access has been activated, you will have access to the moderator-only chat room, aka &quot;The Teachers Lounge&quot;
([direct link]($teachersLounge$)). That’s where moderators from all over the SE network hang out, and they’re happy to answer any questions you might
have. The chat room also archives our messages so you can leave me or other moderators notes and questions which we’ll see later.
**Please make sure that your chat account is associated with the $SiteName$ site so that it will recognize you as a moderator and allow you into the room.**

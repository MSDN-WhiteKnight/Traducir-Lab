The use of ChatGPT as a source for content on $siteName$ is currently banned. Please see the Meta Stack Overflow question &quot;[Temporary policy: ChatGPT is banned]($chatGptBannedUrl$)&quot;. It is not permitted for you to use ChatGPT to create content on $siteName$ during this ban.

**Plagiarism / failure to indicate or attribute work that&#39;s not your own (AI generated text):**  We’ve noticed that at least one of your posts contains text for which you are not the author, which includes AI generated text. Current consensus is that AI generated text requires attribution. See &quot;[Is it acceptable to post answers generated by an AI, such as GitHub Copilot?]($copilotAnswerUrl$)&quot; for more information.

As a general rule, posts should be **your** original work, but including a small passage of text from another source can be a great way to support your post. Please note that **we require full attribution** with a citation/link indicating the original source, and make sure that you **clearly distinguish quoted text from text written by you**. For more information, please see [how to reference material written by others]($referencingUrl$).

**Posting AI generated content without regard to accuracy:**  It is our experience that many users who rapidly obtain content which is AI generated and then copy and paste it into answers are not vetting that content for quality. Using AI as a *tool* to *assist* generating good quality content *might be* reasonable.

Using AI, or other tools, to generate a large quantity of answers without regard to if those answers are *correct and actually answer* the question on which they are posted is not acceptable. Relying solely on readers to judge the correctness of the answer, or even that the answer actually answers the question, is not permitted. It brings down the overall quality of the site. It is *harmful* to your fellow users, burdening them with having to wade through a substantial amount of poor answers. It is often harmful to the question authors on whose questions the answers are posted, as the answers often superficially look reasonable, so the question author spends time on trying to understand the answer, thinking that the person who posted it actually knows what they are talking about, when in reality the answer doesn&#39;t really answer the question or is substantially incorrect.

The policies for what, if any, use will be acceptable of AI or similar technologies as a *tool* to **assist** *you* creating content, particularly answers, on $siteName$ are currently in flux. The restrictions which were in place prior to the existence of ChatGPT were:

1. *You* confirm that what is posted as an answer *actually answers the question*;
2. *You* have sufficient subject matter expertise in the topic of the question to be able to assure that any answer you post is correct (as if you wrote it); and
3. The content copied from such tools is indicated as not your own work by following the requirements for referencing the work of others in [how to reference material written by others]($referencingUrl$), including, but not limited to, that the text which you copy from the AI is indicated as a quote by being in blockquote formatting, and you explicitly attribute the text.

It&#39;s expected that whatever is decided upon as the new policy for using such tools will have *at least* the above requirements, if not be even more stringent, perhaps prohibiting the use of such technologies altogether.

**Some, many, or all of your posts have been deleted:**  Some, many, or all of your posts may have been or will be deleted, because we believe they violate the rules and guidelines mentioned above. If you believe we are in error regarding a specific post, then feel free to raise an &quot;in need of moderator intervention&quot; flag on that post explaining the issue and request the post be reevaluated. You can find links to your deleted posts from your &quot;[deleted questions]($deletedQuestionsUrl$)&quot; and your &quot;[deleted answers]($deletedAnswersUrl$)&quot; pages. Links to the above mentioned deleted post pages can be found at the bottom of the respective [questions]($questionsUrl$) and [answers]($answersUrl$) tabs in your profile.

Still no answer to the question, and you have the same problem? Help us find a solution by researching the problem, then
                    contribute the results of your research and anything additional you’ve tried as a partial answer.
                    That way, even if we can’t figure it out, the next person has more to go on. It’s also possible to gain a bit
                    of reputation with your answers and **vote up** the question so it gets more attention, or you could 
                    [set a bounty]($bountyLink$) on the question.

We&#39;ve noticed that you&#39;ve asked many questions, a large number of which were not well received by other members of our community.

Specifically, many of your questions were downvoted and closed because they seemed to be hastily written, or of the [type that we&#39;d prefer users refrain from asking]($dontAskUrl$). This is a troubling pattern; we&#39;d like to make sure that you&#39;ve read the help that we have available for asking questions. Please take some time to read *all* of the information linked below prior to asking another question:

 - An overview of [how our system works]($aboutUrl$)
 - A brief [guide on how to ask questions]($howToAskUrl$)
 - A short summary of [questions we permit]($onTopicUrl$)
 - Help on [formatting your questions]($editingUrl$)

We recommend taking a look at highly upvoted questions within the tags that interest you as examples of how to ask better questions. We really want you to have a good experience here, and the first step to that is making sure that your questions are clear, on topic and provide all of the information someone would need to answer.

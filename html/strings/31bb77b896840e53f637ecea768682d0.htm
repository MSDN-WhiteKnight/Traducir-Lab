We noticed that many of your posts include things like signatures, tag lines, or other information that isn&#39;t part of your question or answer. We wanted to let you know that we have a place in your profile where you can tell us all about yourself, and it&#39;s directly linked from everything you write. 

Coming from your traditional discussion forums, we understand that it is often customary to be a bit more cordial and chatty in your posts, but at Stack Exchange, one of our goals is to build a library of high-quality questions and answers where it&#39;s as easy as possible to find the best answer. We know this can come across as a bit persnickety &amp;mdash; this crazy Q&amp;A site that hates conversation &amp;mdash; but it&#39;s that &quot;just the answers&quot; ethos that results in over 90% of the questions getting great answers, often stunningly quickly. 

We look forward to your future contributions. We hope you&#39;ll consider telling us about your interests and what you&#39;ve been working on in your profile. We actually love to see it there &amp;mdash; it gives the community a little color on the real people who share their knowledge here &amp;mdash; but we try to keep it out of the main Q&amp;A.
